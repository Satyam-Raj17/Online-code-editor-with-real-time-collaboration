# Real-time Code Collaboration Web Application

## Overview

This project is a real-time code collaboration web application that allows multiple users to simultaneously edit code in the same environment. It's built using a modern JavaScript stack, focusing on providing a seamless and interactive collaborative coding experience.

## Technologies Used

* **Front-end:** React
* **Back-end:** Node.js, Express.js
* **Real-time Communication:** Socket.io
* **Unique ID Generation:** UUID (implicitly used for room IDs)

## Features

* **Real-time Code Editing:** Multiple users can type and see changes reflected instantly.
* **Collaborative Sessions:** Users can join unique rooms to collaborate on code together.
* **Dynamic Front-end:** A responsive and interactive user interface built with React's component-based architecture.
* **Backend Management:** Utilizes Node.js and Express.js to handle API requests, manage user sessions (within the context of a room), and orchestrate real-time communication.
* **WebSocket Communication:** Leverages Socket.io for efficient and low-latency bidirectional communication between clients and the server.
* **Unique Room IDs:** Enables easy sharing and joining of specific collaboration sessions.

## Setup Instructions

While specific setup instructions might depend on the exact implementation details of the tutorial you followed, here's a general outline of how you might set up and run this application:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL]
    cd [YOUR_REPOSITORY_DIRECTORY]
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the server directory:**
    ```bash
    cd server
    ```

3.  **Install server-side dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Start the server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    (or `node server.js` or similar, depending on your `package.json` scripts)

5.  **Navigate to the client directory (in a new terminal):**
    ```bash
    cd ../client
    ```

6.  **Install client-side dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

7.  **Start the client:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    (This usually runs the React development server)

8.  **Open in your browser:** Navigate to the address provided by your client-side development server (usually `http://localhost:3000`).

## Usage

1.  Open the application in your web browser.
2.  You will likely see an option to create a new room or join an existing room.
3.  **Creating a new room:** Clicking "Create New Room" will generate a unique room ID that you can share with others.
4.  **Joining an existing room:** Enter the room ID provided by your collaborator and click "Join Room."
5.  Once in the same room, any code changes you make will be instantly visible to other users in the same room, and vice versa.

## Further Development (Optional)

This project provides a foundation for real-time code collaboration. Potential areas for further development include:

* Syntax highlighting for various programming languages.
* User authentication and authorization.
* Saving and loading code sessions.
* Adding a chat functionality.
* Implementing different collaboration modes (e.g., simultaneous vs. turn-based).
* Testing and improving the stability and scalability of the application.
